# Greedy Algorithms

These are my solutions to week 3 of the [Coursera Algorithmic Toolbox course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox), which is part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms). 

I wrote them in functional style scala as I really like scala and the functional paradigm.

Very interested to hear if anyone has feedback or suggestions!
